### A Personal ToDo List:
## As of now, this is my personal 'to-do' list for this GeeMusic  fork, which I plan on PR-ing back into the main repo when all is said and done... For now, feel free to create an issue on this repo. I'm open to ideas, bug reports, and or fixes for certain pieces of code.

| Idea | Status |
| ----- | ----- |
| Free radio support | In progress |
| Songs by artist bug fix | Needs more research |
| **OPTIONAL FEATURE:** Export songs played to external source | Pending |
| **OPTIONAL FEATURE:** Export song library to an external source | Pending |
